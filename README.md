# üõí Smart Product Recommendation System

## [Demo link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16DA5JMfoMGaJRDVsTaX5lFdZAYKC01rz/view?usp=sharing)

This project is an AI-powered product recommendation system that takes natural language queries from users and returns the most relevant products using:

- **FastAPI** backend  
- **LLM** for query interpretation  
- **Chroma Vector DB** for semantic + metadata filtering  
- A simple **HTML/CSS/JS frontend** to interact with the system  


## Chosen AI Feature

### Option A ‚Äì Smart Product Search

This project implements a Smart Product Search system that allows users to search for products using natural language queries like:

> ‚ÄúShow me women's wear under $10 with good reviews.‚Äù

The system intelligently interprets the query, extracts intent and filters, and returns semantically relevant product recommendations using vector similarity and metadata filtering.
